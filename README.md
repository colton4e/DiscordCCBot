# DiscordCCBot
This bot is currently not in a usable state. Its functionality is limited to joining and leaving voice channels on a text command.
We hope to utilize CMUSphinx to transcribe voice and to either send messages containing transcribed text, or to utilize webhooks to send text to an external program.
